            <Title>Vampire</Title>
            <Text>Origins

The first tribes of humans that walked the earth in prehistoric times often fought, over territories, hunting grounds etc, even among themselves when time were harsh.
In one of those tribes lived two brothers (Cain and Abel), and during a period of famine they fought over whatever food they had left for their own survival.
One of them was killed in the scuffle but a demon that passed by took interest in the conflict. He offered the dying human a unique possibilities. A contract, a deal, that would bring him back from the dead but with consequences.
Abel seized this last chance, not caring that the demon never mentioned a price.
He woke up with no heartbeat, no breath, and an unending thirst for blood.

He lived first for years, hidden away in fear of what he became, committing murders or massacre on whoever or whatever crossed his path.
He eventually learnt (alone) to control himself.
Years more he meddled with humans alone, and finally succumbed to the temptation of having another like him to alleviate loneliness.
He created himself a mate, then a son…

He kept a tight leash on them, until a fight had them separate. They created more, and so did he, keeping to the rule of being hidden, trying to remain a secret, and peaceful (as much as could be) race.
Nowadays about 0.0001% of the world population belong to them (about seven thousands people) and they keep their number stable.


Social Organization

Vampires have a very strict if very simple social structure.
They belong to and depend of the vampire who made them.
Newly created Vampires nowadays are considered ruffian, of low “birth”
The older a vampire is, the more power and rank they gives to their “children”
They call their ranks “Sons”, “Daughters” or “Generations” (Abel is the first Generation, the Father. The “First sons” are by extension “Second Generation”)

A vampire can command and order any other vampire below them, and lower ranked vampires are often used as body guards, hunters, domestics, by higher ranked
A vampire can challenge their “sire” in a fight which must happen with witnesses. The rules and wager of the fight must be defined in front of the same witnesses.
Very often it’s a fight to the death and by removing their “Sire” the vampire (and all others of their rank) climb up a “Generation”


Creation

Creating a vampire is a painful process on both the vampire and the being that turns.
The vampire must first drink the blood of their victim until they are nearing death. Until that is done, not a drop of vampire blood must enter their body, else the process can be unstable and has greater chances to fail.

Once the victim is nearly dead, the vampire must feed their own blood back (which imply being well fed in the first place) to them.
When the victim has absorbed enough blood (the eyes are the first to change, and used to recognise the start of the transformation) the vampire need to finish them off and drink all the life they have left
The human body has a very small chance of rejecting the transformation and dying for real (around 0.001%)

The whole thing doesn’t necessarily take long, but it’s exhausting on both side.

If the victim has already consumed vampire blood in the last forty-eight hours, there is a risk of instability in his body, which increase the chances of reject. The more blood consumed and the more recent it was, the more risk there is.

Feeding habits

Vampires need blood to live. Human blood isn’t a must and all bloods give off different amount of energy but it’s mostly simply a matter of ease. There is many more humans on the planet than anything else, it’s easier to go after them (easy preys) and drinking can be coupled with other activities.
The sensation of power held over another sentient specie is also a great appeal to vampires

They feed thanks to their fangs (a deformation of their canine) by biting deeply enough any point on their victim. Once the wound is open, they simply suck the life liquid and drink it.
The bite is usually painful (as bites tend to be) unless the vampire apply his own blood on it. The “vampire contaminant” of it induce a “high” in the victim, act as a slight anesthetic, and a strong aphrodisiac/relaxing/happy drug and help close the wound.

            <Title>Demon</Title>
            <Text>Origins

Origins of the first demons are rather vague and few, it’s often mentioned that they came to be from drop of darkness fallen in hellfire in a plain where time was out of sync. As poetic as this is, the more realistic explanation is that indeed a drop of pure liquid void fell into a flame and the resulting explosion deformed and contaminated other creatures around it and the world itself. The demon realm thus became a plane all on its own but dependent of the main world and closely linked to it.


Sub-Races

Demons is the main denomination, but among themselves they have many sub-races (incubus/succubus, imps, etc)
Every demon when they come into existence, see a “birthmark” appear somewhere on their skin. It’s a brand and it indicate their sub-race. The mark is a circle, broken in seven pieces, with a flame in the middle.
Each segment correspond to a sub-race, and one (or more) of them will take a triangle shape, indicating the demon sub-race.

Pure-blooded normally have all the triangles-segments, making nearly all noble demons think they’re a separate race.
Opposite to them, contracted have no triangle. And the same thinking applies.


Social Organization

Demons are organized depending on their age, and their bloodline. Since a diluted bloodline means diluted powers they attach a lot of importance to their parentage.
Their society is a monarchy in name, a tyranny in facts. The king/queen is the from the oldest and purest family of demons that exist, and S/he is sitting on the throne only as long as her/is siblings or children don’t forcefully get her/im off it.

The court is composed of all the other families and often the theater of tragedies and betrayals aplenty. Nobles are not required to work, but it’s very encouraged to get into contract with humans to obtain their life force and increase their energy and their strength.

Demons born from a contract (and so who were humans) are the lowest of the low. They’re considered the property of their contractor. (slavery)


Creation

A demon can be created by three different manners:

A drop of darkness fallen in hellfire. As the old poesy goes, a demon can spontaneously come into existence if a drop of liquid void come into contact with hellfire and mix in a stable manner. (very very rare. The rest of the time such reaction is more along the lines of “Boom”)
Procreation. A male and female (as a general rules, demons can be bi-gendered or switch physically) get together and get a baby demon. Nothing too complicated
Contract. A human who make a deal with a demon and at the end of their deal, their soul is twisted into a weakened, very diluted version of the demon that contracted them.

            <Title>Elf</Title>
            <Text>Origins

Origins are slightly blurred but much more certain than demons. Kept either by mouth-to-ear or by paintings and poetry, elves know for almost certain they they are of celestial ascent.
Probably from a fallen angel, whom used his magic to influence plant lives. It is unknown if the process turned against them and thus they became an elf, or if it was their choice, but all angelic abilities were lost in the process and instead elves developed a unique relation to plants.


Social Organization

Elves are organized by forests and continents with one ruling family and a council. The ruling family serve as figurehead, they’re the one with the most powerful magic, best behaved children, most hoarded knowledge.
Elves consider tradition as very important, respect to the elders, and to the plants around them. All life is sacred but not all lives are equals in their eyes.
On the other hand, they have no tradition concerning love, partners, or physical appearance. They consider that beauty must be found and appreciated and consider that someone unable to do so is ill educated or of poor birth.

Children are considered as such until they are capable of commanding an elder tree, which is a tree aged of more than three centuries.
Until then they are under their families responsibilities and theirs to educate. Physical punishment is uncommon but humiliation is considered a fair teacher.
 
In Europe the ruling family is from Emerely, and their leader is Eldiarion.

Magic and Beliefs

Elves are almost all inherently linked to plants and able to use and command them. Offering energy in exchange for whatever service they need.
They can also learn other types of magic beside, though not all of them bother.
Elves have developed a sort of religion/philosophy, based on honoring older trees and praying to them so the forest can hear their wishes
They have very little regard for other kinds who dismiss plants, and consider humans inferior beings for the way they treat their world. Mingling with them is seen as dangerous and disgusting.</Text>

            <Synopsis>The working place of the Martyr's Boys
Where they regroup and spend a lot of their time</Synopsis>
            <Text>Description

Situated between Pigalle and Montmartre, in a small badly lit street.
The street looks often dirty and unsafe though you will never find anyone lingering inside. No beggar, no homeless, no whore. And the smell from it is that of old stone, a bit of mold and heavy dust.

The bar is signaled by a small sign, hanging above a normal looking door (metal, no handle). You have to know it’s the right place, to be able to find it. The street-door is never locked.
Behind it, a square spiraling staircase lead down below street level into the bottom of the hill of Montmartre.
At the bottom, a richly ornate wooden door surrounded by two bas-relief depicting ethereal figures.
This door can be locked and is closed when the bar isn’t open for business.

Behind the door, the reception room give the tone: deep red, drapes and luxurious plushy carpet. On the wall a dark wooden cabinet is used for the clients to put their belongings (cloak etc). Those can be locked with a key.
Past that, a short hallway lead to the main room. It’s a deep and wide space, with a high ceiling, decorated to give out an idea of luxury and riches, as well as warmth and life.

Expensive paintings hung on the wall, there are cushioned chairs and sofas, with many cushions, the carpet extending from the reception room, and the wall are covered in a soothing red-wine wallpaper with filigree.
The light come from several chandeliers on the ceiling and standing candlesticks.

On the left side (from the door) the bar, looking straight out of a renaissance castle, with a black and gold marble top.
There are an impressive collection of bottles behind it, numbered and tagged for easy access. A small side door, hidden behind a curtain, allow access to the cellar and a small kitchen.

In the far wall, behind a draping, the door leading to the private rooms. The first half of such is for the clients. Four rooms, all identical, with a king-sized bed, red velvet drapes and the same wall paper and carpeting as the main room.

A secret door in the furthest corner from the door, lead to the host boys private quarters. Their rooms, which are decorated depending on their preferences of the moment</Text>

            <Title>Werewolf</Title>
            <Text>Origins

A long time ago, before cities and before town even existed, humans were already selling their souls to demons for gain. One of them exchanged his soul against the “strength of wolves”. When came the time to pay, he tried to trick the demon into leaving him be. He managed to make it so no demons could steal his soul from him.
Peace was his for a little while then the demon came back with a revenge. Since he couldn’t take the soul, he instead twisted the contract so that gaining the strength of the wolf would turn into being the wolf.

The curse soak up moonlight whenever there is contact between said light and the cursed. With enough moonlight the transformation is triggered and the werewolf turn into their wolf form.
The transformation, once started, cannot be canceled or avoided, or controlled. The human mind turn animalistic though it retain partial intelligence. Once the transformation is done, time and lack of moonlight will trigger the reverse process.


Social Organization

Werewolves are organized in packs, the Alphas being the strongest and most cunning wolves, as well as often the one who turned the others. Whenever the pack has a gathering, the Alpha will be the one to have the best food, best place to rest, and first attempt at getting on with the females or males of the pack.
Once the Alpha deems he had enough food, drink, rest, and flirting, the others are allowed access to those things

Females and Males are seen as equals, since the superiority of a member of the pack is determined by their ability to beat down the others.

Werewolves are sensitive to seasons as they can come down with “heat” and “mating periods”. They will be more aggressive, more pressing for intercourse during that time. The pack tend to make sure members in mating will stay with the pack so they don’t risk forcing anyone that wouldn’t be able to fight back, into anything (as it happened in the past and punishment had to be met out and nobody was happy about that)


Creation

Werewolves can be made, by biting and infecting a human with the curse
Or they can be born (male + female = baby wolf). If born, it can be from two werewolves parents, or only one. The baby purity (and strength) will depend of this.

A bitten were will be weaker than a born werewolf and very rarely get to be alpha of a pack. The less mingling with humans or with bitten there is in a bloodline, the stronger the newborn were will be.</Text>

            <Text>“Will you keep still? You move again, I swear I’ll stick this somewhere painful on purpose!” some laughs, a roll of eye, and Fel’ looked up at her ‘mannequin’s, a soft mischievous glint to her greenish eyes. “I’m going to sew that the wrong way up, and it’ll be your fault!” she warned, waving the needle fake-threateningly, earning more laughs from her friends around.

Lois humphed, straightening again. She stood much higher than her friend, with a more solid frame, tanned skin and black hair. But it was her more masculine features that often scared away people. Yet she couldn’t help but follow the needle with weary blue eyes under thick frowny brows as Fel’ drove it down into the fabric, assembling the required pieces for the costume that she was wearing.
“You’re going to prick me!” she exclaimed suddenly, jerking back once again.

“Am not! If you would stop moving! Crybaby!” Hands on her hips, the blond threw the needle down on the nearby table. “Honestly, I guard kids that are less troubles than you!”

“You’re a walking catastrophe! I’m sorry if I don’t like you and needles together near me!”

As they started to argue, Lucia paused her own work to watch them with a fond grin, pushing back a strand of black hair with its dyed vivid red tip from her brown eyes, ignoring the paint that peppered her olive skin. She and Julie were painting the armour pieces that had been made earlier. It wasn’t a work where one kept clean.

The group of friends was used to such banter. They had known each other for so long now and they were nearly always having fun -or getting in troubles- together. And of course their common interests helped with this a lot. Right now said interest laid in costume making. And Lois’s cosplay was taking shape very well.
In fact they were certain that they could finish it before the convention actually started. They had managed to get the school to lend them an empty room for this, after much begging. And on this silent Wednesday, their voices were the only thing that made the place alive.

“Lois stop being such a wimp.” Julie commented, turning to look at the arguing pair, a streak of black paint across her face visible only thanks to the oily texture that contrasted with her chocolate skin. “Last I checked, you were the one who said you couldn’t sew to save your life.”

“Oh she can’t!” Fel’ cut short to any protest before it was even formed, and backed a step to eye off her work. It wasn’t… too bad. She could of done better had the ‘subject’ squirmed a bit less. But as it was, it looked good enough.
“Well fine, I think we can stop here anyway… Miss ‘scared-of-needles’.”

A raspberry was all the answer she got as she put away the sewing kit and dragged a cardboard knife closer. They still had the whole back to do, and they needed to hurry before the school closed and they had to leave.
Sitting herself on one of the classroom table, she started cutting down the thick pieces of packing material using the earlier traced lines they all decided upon, to guide her hand.

Looking by the window at the street below them, she smiled. People… with their own things to do, rushing to work, rushing home, rushing here and there.
And she and her friends were here on a free day, in school, to finish up a project that they had all worked so hard on. Nice moment to wonder on existential questions. But it did put life in perspective to look at others like this and Fel’ loved it. Just as she loved conventions and what they allowed her and the girls to do.
Mimicking fantasy characters, being free of everybody else standard just for one day. They all needed and craved this, and convention-day had never seemed so close and yet so far.

“And you Fel’?”

“Uh?” she turned to see her friends expectantly looking at her. Ah crap, she hadn’t listened, she had no clue what the conversation had been about. And knowing the others, it could have been anything. “Er… I agree with Lucia?”

They chuckled teasingly.
“Someone been in the clouds.” Lucia commented “But no, the question was: if you could get magical abilities, which one you’d want? I picked flight. Child dream that is.”

Lois and Julie mentioned their choices as well:
“Shape-shifting. Damn I wish.”
“Super sight or super speed…”

Fel’ paused her cutting a moment as she thought about it, then shrugged.
“Dunno… fast healing? Like in the x-men… But then, there is always a downside… like turning into a zombie or ageing super fast in return…”

She resumed the path of the knife on the cardboard, distracted as the debate continued on… Magical power. They all wished for those at some point or other didn’t they. To have somethings nobody else had. Fel’ had her own period of jealousy when she met the other girls, when she was envious of them. Wasn’t it the same thing?
To have Lucia golden fingers and her piano talent, or Julie hands for drawing. To have Lois bravery and her determination. Or to have powers to be better than anyone else.

It took her years and her friends support to see she had things they did not, which were just as good. Like her singing voice, or her curiosity and logic. But the knowledge of now did nothing to erase the shame of then.

Lost in those moody thoughts, she failed to see her own hand on the path of the knife.

She shrieked in surprise and pain, dropped the cutter and the cardboard alike as blood splashed around.
“Fuckdamnit!” holding her hand up, she saw from the corner of an eye the other three jumping to help, Lois pulling out a clean handkerchief from her bag as Julie pulled her hand to see.

“Okay, it’s not too bad. Doesn’t look deep. I think.”

“You think?!” maybe it was the pain but there was something very funny about this… “I might need to sit down…” she slumped on the table again, just then realising she had stood up.
She looked at the esoteric symbols from the cosplay parts, now covered in blood and completely impossible to use.
“Wasted hours of work…” she commented, but Lucia shushed her.
“Forget the work, you’re hurt, you dumbass.”
Fel’ nodded then grinned
“Mind you, it’s a realistic touch… a warlock costume with real blood on it…”
Lois chuckled as she finished bandaging her hand very tight, and waited to see if blood was still running… when the kerchief just barely started to stain, she nodded.
“Alright you’re good. And yeah, realistic and creepy. Don’t want your blood on me all day long… I’d be summoning troubles with that, not demons…”

“Hey you never know!” She still hurt, her hand was throbbing, but the accident was just that and her friends being here made Fel’ forget the pain easily and lean toward joking it off. It was always easier to laugh off the hurt. Picking up one of the pieces, she waved it around with a smirk.
“Hear me forces of the world!” she started, and the other three rolled their eyes at her antics. They also smiled, relieved to see her messing around and so she continued. “I, Felina, call upon thee now! Lend me your strength! Grant me power!” she forced her voice into a theatrical howl and saw Julie start to snort as she tried not to laugh. “I sell you my soul, on my blood I swear, for power given in exchange!”

“Too vague, you could get tricked!” Lois was snickering out loud now, commenting on her performance and Fel’ laughed. Too vague heh? Alright, she would narrow it down!
“Power for me and me alone to use! Power unique only to me! Power no one else ever had, will ever have! Hear me! I take this Oath!” she finished under loud laughs, her own as loud as the others. Her friends were in stitches around her and she joined them easily.

“You were ridiculous!” Lucia commented, leaning on a nearby desk to get her breath back. “If you’re that fine, then help us put everything away… it’s getting too late to get much done and we’ll need to clean before we go. Don’t want to leave blood here, the school might ask questions…”

“Yeah and Fel need to get home and get a real bandage on that cut.” Lois added, looking pointedly at her friend, who held her hand up placatingly.
“Yes, yes, I promise.”Fel chuckled. &quot;See... fast-healing would be cool right now.&quot;

    &quot;Oh shut up...&quot; the other groaned even as they laughed too.

After that it was a flurry of cleaning up, picking all the scattered pieces of cosplay, locking them into the spare locker that they had, and fetching a mop and bucket from the cleaning cupboard.
Fifteen minutes later there wasn’t a trace of what they got up to, and after closing the cupboard, the group of friends headed off to the nearest bus station. Waving one another goodbye as they split up to go home, leaving Fel walking alone to the subway entrance close by…
She didn’t live the farthest out of all of them, but she still picked the metro as the quickest choice to get home… Even if it was stuffy, smelly and full of stupid people.
She felt some stares on the way, and was aware that not all of those were for her bandaged hand as she slipped it in her pocket.
She turned to glare at the crowd around her, the situation worsening as she left the train. The group of boys sitting nearby who had been ogling her ass whistled, and she resisted the urge to shiver still feeling the gazes of people around her. She hated the way they looked at her, hated the way the world worked, and most of all, hated this feeling of being… a prey. For lack of a better word.

She hurried out the station, not wanting to deal with it any longer than she really had to.

When she finally reached her flat she kicked off her shoes and walked to the bathroom to remove the kerchief, bandage her hand properly and disinfect the wound. She wasn’t watching the mirror, she was focused on her hand and she didn’t saw the trickle of gold that entered her flat through the open window.
She didn’t see the shadow crawling behind her, until it was touching her back. She didn’t see either of those thing as they touched her and seemed to vanish, absorbed in her body. She didn’t hear the ghostly faint whisper of a voice murmuring “We heard you little girl, we take the oath little girl. Be mine little girl.”
She only felt a shiver, sudden and icy, running down her spine, making her spin around, looking wildly for an intruder that wasn’t there…

Then she shrugged it off, chalking it on nerves, and returned to her everyday tasks… unaware…</Text>

            <Title>After School</Title>
            <Synopsis>Present school day, Fel's friend, first meeting with Darkon</Synopsis>
            <Text>One week later, on Monday, Fel grumbled as she heard the long high pitched whine of her alarm clock and she reached a hand from the cocoon of blankets to try and make it stop.
Fumbling around without reaching it, she peeked out from her bed, hair a mess, tired still from the two days long convention fun.
It had been an amazing time, the cosplay had been a success, and over all, the girls and her had way too much fun.
The problem was the downfall, on a school day.

Finally finding her alarm, Fel’ pushed the button to turn it off, and gave a quick glance to the small screen. Slumping back in bed for a second before suddenly springing up, remembering the day and seeing how late she was.
Throwing off her pyjamas, pulling on the first jeans and t-shirt she could find in her wardrobe, she ran out the door with a toast in hand and her bag half-slung on her shoulder.

She reached the school just as the guardian started to close the fence, and managed to get to her classroom before the teacher. Falling at her desk, she sat down, trying to get her breathing back under control.
She waved at Lois and Lucia who sat too far away to talk to. Then turned to Julie on the chair next to hers, as her friend leaned toward her.
“Someone forgot to get up?” Julie teased with a grin.
Fel’ waved her off with a fake-glare, the effect being broken by her still ragged breathing.

Their advanced math teacher choose that moment to come in and all the students straightened on their seat, before standing up in greetings until they were waved back down.
“Hello class. I hope you remembered to work a bit for today’s test.” He announced, earning a wave of discontent whispering.
“I know, I know, I’m a terrible tyrant of a teacher. Now take a blank paper, I want to see nothing else than a pen and your calculator. I will pass along to give you the subject.” He started doing so while finishing to speak. “I shouldn’t need to remind you all, but I’ll still do so, that anyone I catch looking sideway will get a zero and a disciplinary warning.”

Fel’ blanked him out as he returned to his desk, and she stared at the test subject in horror. She had completely forgotten about this!
With the convention, the cosplay making and the nightmares she started to have -which she blamed on a lack of sleep- and augmented stress… She had no idea what this was about…
Taking a deep breath and hoping for something easy, she opened the subject and read the first question.
Then cursed in a vitriolic and creative whisper. She was doomed…



Half an hour and half a page of desperate scribbling later, Fel, as well as all the other students, looked up as someone knocked on the door, and came in.
The Dean of the science department looked at them all from behind his square glasses, dark brown hair cut military style. The students seemed hesitant about standing and greeting in the middle of a test and  rightly so as they were waved down.
“I would like everyone attention please. I’ll be brief but this is important.” He looked at all of them carefully, before resuming. “Recently it came to our attention that some students around the school have been victims of aggressions, or caught carrying around illegal substance. We’re doing everything we can to make the school safe and catch the perpetrators, but until we manage to do this, I would ask all of you to be very careful. Don’t leave you belongings lying around, don’t walk alone after dark, and if you see anything suspicious, report it immediately.”

He nodded briskly, then left the room behind.
As soon as he was out, the class started to whisper and mutter, the volume climbing steadily up until the teacher voice rose above the rest.
“Silence! This is still a test! Everyone sit down, and return to your paper! And silence!”
Nobody spoke a word during the rest of the exam. But many glances were exchanged…



After the test, Fel’ didn’t had time to speak to the rest of her ‘gang’. They had different classes, spread out across the building and from their timetables, they knew they wouldn’t get to see one another before this evening on the way out.
Hurrying out of class, they managed to exchange a brief hello, before the bell reminded them that not all students had time to gossip… which was a damn shame, since the dean announcement was already spreading like wildfire in the whole school.

When the evening arrived, the four of them met at the main door, and as soon as they were in earshot, Julie exclaimed:
“Do you believe that?! Aggressions?!”
Making them nod and Lucia added
“I know, it’s crazy… I mean this is La Sorbonne! You shouldn’t get this kind of stuff here!”
Fel’s frowned and saw Lois looking as septic as her.
“Don’t talk bull. This kind of things do happen even here. First time it’s enough a fuss that we hear of it, that’s all. You remember Catherine right? She was attacked at the metro station, not even five minutes away. I’m more surprised that they admitted it, that mean it must be bad.”

“Yeah well… that doesn’t make me want to go home alone… any of you girls want to crash at my place?” Lucia asked, looking unsure.

“Heh… why not. My parents are home early and if I can avoid seeing them, I will.” Lois nodded, and Julie shrugged knowing all too well about Lois’s family and her home issue, and knowing their unspoken rule of not mentioning it. She also looked at Fel’
“Want to walk home with someone?”

“If you don’t mind sleeping on the sofa… we do have a movie binge to do.”
Waving goodbyes to the other two, bags slung over their back, Fel’ and Julie exited the school and aimed for the station, discussing their planned movie night and comparing actors.

Just as they turned away the corner, Fel’ bumped into someone. Immediately apologising, she wouldn’t have even looked up, if it the person she bumped into hadn’t said
“Hey bitch what’d you think you did?”

She stopped, and levelled a glare at the man. Distasteful clothing, badly shaved, and stinking of alcohol, and drug-smoke.
“I walked. I said sorry. I’m going.” She responded in a clipped voice, seeing Julie tense beside her, hand going for the pepper spray that she kept in her pocket…

“I don’t think so, see you bumped into me. That wasn’t polite.” The man insisted and Julie started to pull out the spray when suddenly a hand closed on her arm and swung her around. She cried out in pain, and Fel’ turned immediately to face another assailant, clothed similarly to the other one and leering just as badly.
“What were you doing pretty bird? Heh? Got something under those ugly-ass clothes?”

“Oh they got somethings alright, look at the rack on this one!” the first one laughed pointing to Fel’s chest, and she clenched her teeth in rage.

“Where you two going anyway heh? Why don’t you join us, going to have a little fun!” the pair of man laughed again.
Julie twisted and tried to free her arm but her punches were inefficient and she was held too far to do much damage.
Then the man holding her slammed her into the nearest wall, making her cry out again, before he started slipping his hand beneath her shirt…

Fel jumped to try and help but before she could do one step, he felt hands grasping her own arms and push her down. She scrapped painfully against the concrete before a boot was pushed to her back.
“Your turn after bitch, don’t worry.” She heard from behind her, and she snarled, trying and failing to aim a kick at her attacker.

All those big talks about fighting back and being able to defend themselves… imagining such situation during girl nights and talking big about fearing no one… and it all fell apart because nothing could prepare you to a real aggression… 
She looked at Julie desperate face, and tried to think of something… anything to save them…
She tried screaming for help, but nobody came, people passed by, not far from them, in the street right by, on the opposite sidewalk, looking down, walking faster. Not their problem, so used to violence, didn’t want to get in troubles…

She felt the man behind her grab her hair and pull her head back, she heard him laugh… and then she heard a crack and for a moment she thought it was her neck, and she almost screamed. Then she realised it wasn’t her. The crack had came from behind her, loud and followed by a scream of pain that belonged to her aggressor.
The pressure on her head vanished and she dropped to the ground again. She caught sight of Julie face and the man holding her, both looking astonished at what happened, and she spun around to see why she had been released.

Her aggressor was holding his arm, whimpering at the pain, the reason for it obvious: the flesh was red, swelling, inflamed. She thought she could see a bit of white nearly poking out from beneath the skin.
Standing beside him was a young man. He looked about mid-twenty, slim and fit, smug and sure of himself, a smirk playing at his lips as he watched the other man holding his arm.
He was wearing an outfit that wouldn’t have been out of place in a convention, but was very strange looking in the middle of the street. Long deep sea-blue coat, tailored and fitting him like a glove, enhancing his sharp features. That and his silver hair (dyed, they had to be dyed) made him look surreal…

He didn’t say anything, simply watched as the man turned his face back to him with a snarl, and lunged forward for a punch. A simple side-step, and suddenly their silver-haired saviour was holding their aggressor at arm-length, hanging by the road as traffic roared by.

“Oh god! Oh god! Don’t! Please man Don’t!” the man immediately started to beg and blabber, and silver-head simply tilted his head…
“Why not? You didn’t stop when the girls wanted you to. Why should I?” he asked with an amused voice looking very much serious and Fel’ thought he actually was about to throw the man beneath a car. But then he shook his head and threw the guy back on the pavement.

The other assailant had released Julie and looked torn between fighting or running. Silver-head did the choice for him, and faster than any of them could react, he had sunk a punch into the guy stomach, dropping him to the ground, whining and hurting.

The two aggressors seemed to finally realise they were outclassed and decided to just flee the scene as best as they could, leaving Julie and Fel’ helping one another up, alone with Silver-head.
Said man looked at them, appraising them with his eyes, then smirked again smug and so satisfied…

Despite that Fel’ knew they owed him quite a lot there.
“Thanks for that… we’d been screwed without you.”
But he didn’t stay to listen. Half-way into her thanks, he turned heels and started walking away.
It took Fel’ a second or two to react, the adrenaline rush catching up with her again and she pushed herself up to run after him.
“Hey! Wait!” she saw him turn the corner, and ran faster. “I said hey! You bastard! wait!”
She took the bend, and stopped, astonished. Silver-head was nowhere to be seen. There was barely anyone in that street, it went on for a while, no side alley to go into, and yet… he was gone.
“How… where did…” she panted, eyes going wildly left and right, trying to spot the obvious silver color…

She jumped when she felt a hand on her shoulder but it was only Julie.
“You okay?” she enquired, worried and looking quite a bit shaken herself.
Fel’ nodded, shaking as she tried to spot their mysterious saviour again to no avail.
“Just… let’s go home okay? Please…”
Fel’ looked at her friend again, and finally realised how pale and shaken she really was. Nodding, she grabbed her arm and led her away, leaving behind the sad scene of their aggression…</Text>

            <Text>Description

Advanced Science University
Placed near the Sorbonne, the student district as Parisians often call it, the university is composed of a math department, a physic department, a chemistry department and a biology department.
Each department has its own floor, with labs and classrooms. Each room can hold about thirty students at the time, except the labs which can hold twelve to fifteen.
The break rooms and lunch areas are common to all the department.
School ground isn’t big enough for any sportive complex or gardens, but the Sorbonne being nearby the students make due.
They have half-price tickets to all the nearby restaurants, events, and students aimed business (like bookshops etc)

The building is old and despite recent renovation, still possess a very rustic air to it.
The teachers are used to strong, independent students and try to form more of those from whatever ‘children’ manage to get past the entrance exam.
No uniform, but a minimum of self-respect is required from all.

The labs are locked closed when not used and only members of the required staff have keys to those to avoid accidents.</Text>

Learn about the Martyr's bar existence</Synopsis>
            <Text>The next day, after the improvised sleepover, Fel’ woke up next morning to a heavy mind. She had spent the earlier night trying to distract herself from the whole attack and rescue that they went through, but even after a long sleep, the images kept coming to her.
Replaying the arrival of the mysterious stranger -and bastard- who just left them there after saving them.

Arriving to school, both she and Julie joined up with the rest of their group, and explained to the other two what happened the previous day. Only to learn in turn that the two men had been found early this morning in front of the nearby police station, confessing to the previous night aggressions and many other crimes, begging to be let inside least “The monsters might get them”.
The news went around the school like wildfire, as well as the story of what happened to Fel and Julie’s.
Which made for quite an annoying week, with all the students trying to come talk to them, ask questions and see them. It was as if they were members of a freak show.
Didn’t people realise it was a traumatising event? Didn’t they think that maybe the two girl didn’t want to think of it, even less talk of it? But no, people didn’t care, they only wanted to hear the gritty details.

Several times Fel’ had to fend off a crowd of idiots asking questions, and commenting on what happened as if it was nothing more than a story to them. Which it was in fact. It was a story unless it happened to you. Julie and her realised now that for all the so-called sympathy that their kind was supposed to have, people did not care unless they went through the same thing.

Thankfully, slowly, the buzz died out. Nothing more happening about it meant the interest died -which Fel quite appreciated, and she knew Julie did too- and soon, life seemed fully back to normal for all with everyone moving on and even forgetting it happened.

Even the girls seemed to have pushed the incident behind them… except Fel. Who had not given up the idea of finding her mysterious rescuer. But despite her best efforts she didn’t had much to go on. A face that she vaguely remembered, and scribbled around as best as she could on her notebook. And that was it.
No name, no address…

The girls tried everything that they could think of to help her, being initially as curious as Fel.
Going to the police for details, explaining that they were attacked the day before, yielded nothing but long awkward hours sitting at a desk and describing said attack in details all over again under the scrutiny of a well-intentioned policeman.
The school surveillance had nothing either because it didn’t happen on school ground. They checked themselves with some bribery to the student representatives in order to access the security room.

All in all, after more than a week of best efforts, they were all gathered together in an empty class again. And quite disheartened.

“So… nothing.”

“Not much we could hope to do… unless we bumped into him again, I mean, no name…”

A general sigh, filled with more disappointment. Lucia was, as often, the voice of logic to Julie stating the obvious. Lois on the other hand was bitterness incarnated.
“He’s probably one of those wannabe hero, trying to play it cool with no rewards and stuff. Swooping in to save the damsel in distress.” She snarked, and they all knew her well enough to hear the invisible quotes and know it was said only to cover her dissatisfaction.

Fel snorted from her slumped position across two desks.
“You didn’t see his smirk.” She countered without even looking at the others. “He was a smug bastard. He didn’t leave out of humbleness. He’s done all this because he had some sort of weird plan…” She said those last words without thinking, and for a moment she wondered where it came from… but after looking back on it, she was sure she was right. She couldn’t tell how she knew, but she did.
And she remembered the arm of their aggressor… the white nearly poking through. Silver-head had broken the guy arm with one hand and without any efforts.
And that was another reason to find him in her opinion. The guy was dangerous… he might be worse than the original thugs and the police might want him too. Maybe he was on drugs… a new type of drugs with cool side effects like super strength, and bad one like psychosis.

Okay it wasn’t a nice thing to do, to turn in someone who saved your life, but… not every good Samaritan was scary like that one had been. She wouldn’t turn in a boy or girl scout. She would definitely turn in a weirdo that could break arms without breaking a sweat.

“Should we give up maybe?” Julie asked, earned some half-hearted glares. None of them wanted to give up now and waste the efforts they put in this. Beside they felt too implicated. But truthfully none of them wanted to continue either. They had reached a point where they wished for a solution to appear, because they could not see any themselves and while giving up was not an option mentioned out loud, it was on every mind.

After more silence, they decided to pack up and head home. Staying here and moping wouldn’t do anything for them except lower their moral even more.
Bags on backs, mumbling goodbyes, they scattered at the usual junction, each of them taking the path that led to their way home.
As she turned the corner, Fel’ felt her phone buzzing in her pocket and fished it out. The display showed her mom picture, and she rolled her eyes. Of course her mom would call now.
She hesitated a second between taking the call or not, then with a long suffering sigh, she stopped on the side of the street, and swiped the call on.
“Yeah?”

“Felina? Hello pumpkin! How are you?”
Her mom voice was high pitched, forced like it always was on mundane events, distorted slightly by the phone, accompanied by the click and clank of glasses and the rumble of voices.
Probably another reception.

“I’m fine mom…”

“Good! I was so worried! Your school phoned, about the aggressions! I was out of my mind, thinking that something might have happened to you!”
Laughter in the back, a thump as her mother covered the speaker and shouted something to the guests before coming back to the phone.
“Sorry for that honey, you know how it is, so many things to organise… so how is your school year going then?”

Already forgotten the aggression, have you mom?
“… very good mom. I got some nice grades… also done a side project with the girls.”

“That’s great! Very good! Don’t forget, getting out of school with a good diploma, that’s what matter okay? And you still got your friends too… Louis too, right? That’s also great.” Fel’ grimaced as she heard both the spoken and the unspoken words there.

Judging me again. Judging them again. Not going to ask about what I’m doing, in the end what does it matter, heh mom?

Her mother didn’t like Lois. She didn’t understand her friends, and their choices, and she didn’t like Fel’ hanging out with them. She worried that her daughter might pick up what she called “bad habits”. From Lois in particular, who she continued to call Louis.

It had been going on for so long that Fel’ didn’t even try anymore. And she and Lois never spoke of it either because it was useless.

“Oh, your sister and dad say hello! They miss you very much!”
Fel’ refrained from laughing, remembering the last time her sister and her spoke. She doubted a hello was really what she said. With the love-hate relation they had, it was more likely to be a fuck off or something of the same calibre. Followed by a sincere ‘Miss you’. That was how it worked for them.

“I say hello too.” She replied to her mom, pushing from the wall against which she leaned, knowing that the conversation was nearing an end, as always. Her mom called, asked enough questions to think she knew her daughter and cared about her.

“I got to go sweetheart, but it was good hearing from you. I love you, bye!”

The steady beep of the phone tone followed almost immediately, and Fel’ sighed.
“Yeah… love you too mom.”
And she did. She sincerely did. Just like she knew her mom really did love her, but simply didn’t know how to show it. Because her mom saw her as “her” daughter. A being that had to prove to the word how good a mother she was. Which meant Fel’ had to be specifically as expected, and behave a certain way which was the only good way to be. And her mom didn’t thought that “good” might hurt or might not be what her daughter really was.

She was about to put her phone back in her pocket when she felt someone bump into her. Her aggression being still so recent she bristled as she stumbled, a curse on her lips. Before it could slip out her lips and before she touched the ground, she felt strong hands grabbing her and steadying her.
A pair of lips brushed against her ear from behind, whoever had first pushed, then helped her, still holding onto her. Sending shivers down her spine. And a soft voice whispered.
“Martyr’s Bar.”

Before the hands released their hold.
Blinking a bit under the suddenness, Fel spun around and caught the glint of silver hair and blue jacket turning the corner. The surprise was so great that she stayed a good minute rooted on the spot, before snapping out of it.

Cursing loudly, she ran after him, turned the street… and was left to stomp her feet and snarl angrily. She lost the damn bastard! Again!

Then she thought about the name he just whispered to her. Pulling out her phone once more, she typed it in the search bar. This time she had a trail!</Text>

            <Synopsis>Fel visit the Martyr's bar</Synopsis>
            <Text>A quick series of sms and some Internet searches had yielded an address to go with the name. From what Fel’ had found, the Martyr’s Bar was located around Montmartre, a barely known place that had no evaluation on any restaurant or bar websites which implied it was probably a dismally small place.

Still, it was a hint… or a reveal, or a rendez-vous or something! In any case, much better than the nothing they had before!
There was no opening hours anywhere on any websites, but Fel’ figured since it was a bar, it probably was open every day in the evening at the very least.
So she had ran back to school, called back her gang, and got them to reunite immediately once again. Forget that this was a free afternoon, they were all close by and she didn’t want to do this without them! They were involved!
As soon as they all got there the girls tried to organise themselves to go to the bar as soon as possible,ideally this very evening. Planning a ‘frontal assault’ all together for safety.

But of course it couldn’t be as easy as that. One or another of them couldn’t come this evening, or any of the following ones that they discussed about. And the idea of waiting longer left a sour taste in Fel’s mouth.

“Next Saturday then!” she heard Julie say, tapping the calendar with a pen.

“Nah, can’t, baby-sitting.” Lucia replied, frowning as once again the date was pushed back.
They looked up as Fel’ mumbled something suddenly, obviously having had enough. “What?” Lucia asked her to repeat, not wanting to believe she heard right.

“I said: I’m going tonight.”

“Wha-?!””You can’t!”

Holding a hand up to stop them, Fel’ announced her plan quickly and harshly. She didn’t want to risk being swayed into changing her mind, and she knew her friend could come up with pretty good arguments when they wanted to.
“I’m going tonight, because I don’t know if it’s a meeting, if he works there, or whatever, and if I don’t go I might miss him. I’m not going to miss this because one of you can’t come. Whoever want with, follow, the others I’m sorry, I’ll tell you all about it the next day.”
It was rare for them to not do things as a group, and Fel’ really didn’t want to do this to them, but it was too important. She couldn’t take that risk, no matter how much she loved her friends. She would go without them if she had to.

There was an exchange of worried glance, the girls evaluating how serious she was. Then Lois nodded
“Ain’t stupid actually… I mean, she’s right, it might be a one-off thing.” She looked at Julie and Lucia. “Sorry for you two, but I’ll go too. Safer than if she went alone and I got nothing tonight.”

The duo of left-behind wasn’t too happy about this plan, but they couldn’t do anything aside from going along. So they did, grumbling and frowning.

That evening, Fel’ joined up with Lois, a picture of the directions for the bar saved into her phone. They started by taking the metro up to Pigalle before returning on street level to try and find the right street.
Despite her determination, Fel’ was glad to have Lois here with her. Pigalle was not a district one wanted to be in, at night, alone. It was a place famous for its sex-workers, alcohol, parties…
The main streets were all sparkles and tourist-traps but as soon as you started walking away, the city became dark, damp and stunk of human misery.

It took them fifteen minute to reach the small alley, the half-screwed slab with the street-name being so dirty that they could barely see what was written on it… a U and a R the only letters that could be identified with certainty, but the street around were the right ones, and it was the only alley that crossed them.
Entering the impasse, walking close to each other, the girls peered at the dark walls, trying to find something that would signal the bar. It took them walking the length of the street twice, before they finally spotted the sign that pointed to a door in a recess of the left wall. Standing in front of the dark painted metal entrance, they paused.
“… you sure it’s here?” Lois asked, looking around as if expecting to be jumped by some criminal any second.

“Well… the plan say yes. The sign say yes… it’s completely failed as far as advertising goes, but I’d say yes?”

“Maybe it’s closed… an abandoned bar that became a lair for criminals or junkies. Or both.”

Fel’ gave her friend a flat stare.
“Seriously? Not helping.”
Turning to the door again, she took a deep breath, and searched for a handle, then finding none, she shrugged and pushed the door.
Despite its disarrayed looks, it opened smoothly, without any creaking. On the other side was not, as one might expect, a bar or the ruins of one. Behind the door was a staircase. A square stone staircase that descended deeply under the ground, lit by elegant lanterns embedded in the walls.

“Okay. Not what I was expecting.” Fel’ said, peering in. Her footsteps echoed loudly in the ambient silence. Lois nodded and followed, still holding the door open. They had seen too many movies in which the door locked when the main character closed it Added to the whole atmosphere of this place it only fuelled their paranoia.
“… We go down?”

“Well, we came to see what was here… I’d say let’s.” But even as she said that, she rummaged her bag to pull out the small can of pepper spray she always had on her. Lois nodded and pulled a penknife, unfolding the blade, and keeping it lightly hidden in the sleeve of her jacket.
Thus armed, they started to go down the long flight of stairs, letting go of the door which closed behind them with a loud clapping noise. As soon as it was shut, the noises of the outside muffled down to a murmur, making their breathing and steps that much louder.

Down and down they went, counting the steps mentally, hand on the ornate rail. They felt like they were going inside the heart of Montmartre hill itself.
Finally, after exactly seventy-seven steps and a few minutes that felt like hours, they reached the bottom. And faced another door.
This one, unlike the first, was a wooden work of art, carved, with gold covering the bas-relief.

This time as they were already “armed” they did not hesitate, exchanging just a glance before pushing the door open. No noise from the door itself again but as soon as it was open, the soft sound of music reached them coming from inside.
They entered a sort of hallway, wide-eyed and awed at the sight. Everywhere red velvet adorned the walls, curtains were draped around the corners, cabinet of dark wood that wouldn’t have looked out of place in a castle were propped against the walls.

At the end of it, an archway covered by a heavy wine-red curtain, that they quickly pushed aside as they went through.

The new room was similar to the first, but so much more gorgeous. The hallway was reception and depicting riches. But this? This was luxury.
Everything was dark wood, gold and rich deep red. There were paintings on the walls, depicting women and men dancing or posing naked in some antic setting, chandeliers with candles that gave the room its soft warm light and diffused a light pleasant scent.
This room also had more furniture. Sofas, and cushioned armchairs that a queen or a king wouldn’t have refused, placed on a carpet that looked like fluff itself. There was even a bar on the left, with drinks and bottles already out on display.
It was a room made to receive people, to welcome, to show-off. It was to display opulence and life… to seduce any who dared take a step inside, and loose them in an other-worldly decadence.

Before they could fully take everything in, a deep low voice startled them, making them spin to face the bar.
Behind it stood a dark haired man with olive skin, a small goatee and sideburns adorned his face, as he fixed them with eyes of a surprising yellow shade.
“This establishment doesn’t allow children. Please take the door behind you and get out.”</Text>

            <Text>“Did you hear me? This is not the kind of place you two should be in. Get Out.” He repeated, glaring now as he set down the glass.
Fel’ finally recovered enough from her surprise and embarrassment, to answer
“We’re not minor.” She growled out, glaring now in turn. “And we’re not leaving.”

“That wasn’t a question.” He said, an eyebrow rising up.

“That wasn’t an answer.” Fel’ replied, holding her ground and the staring contest that had started between them. “We came here to speak to someone.” She added as she suddenly tore herself away. She couldn’t hold his gaze any longer, and she could hear the satisfied smirk as he spoke next.

“You’re telling me you two are clients then?”

Lois bristled next to her, and she wondered if she would have to hold her down, when she spotted movement from the corner of an eye.
Looking to the back of the room she saw a door open behind one of the curtain, and someone padded in the room, rubbing sleep out of their eyes.
Electric blue hair, pale skin, and clothes… well they wouldn’t have looked out of place in a cosplay convention but the frilly shirt and leather pants were a weird sight here.
The young man stopped when he spotted then, looking surprised for a moment, then grinned a hundred watt smile at them, showing off pearly whites that gave both girl shivers.
There was something in his eyes…

“Well hello there~” he quite positively purred at them, before slowly prowling up to them. Granite grey eyes jumped from Fel’ to Lois in turns, like a cat deciding what bird to pounce first.
“What are two lovely ladies like you doing here?” he stood not even one meter away, and the girls had the strong urge to run. “Came to taste the delights? Or to give me a taste maybe?” he teased, leaning toward Lois, reaching a hand out to gently run a finger along her face…
He had to duck suddenly as she brought her hand for a slap, finding his manners both creepy and invading, but she reached only air and he chuckled at her attempt.
“Whoa careful sweetheart! It cost more if we play rough.”

Fel’ glare should of burned, but the teasing little bastard still stood there laughing. And then his attention turned to her.
“And you princess? Smelling that amazing, you got to taste just as good. Going to let me find out?” he stepped closer, and Fel backed off. One step back for each of his steps forward until she felt her back bump into the wall.
“Stay back!” she warned him, feeling her hand grasp tight on the can of pepper-spray. She thumbed off the cap, and put a finger on the head, ready to use it.
He only chuckled, a rich and smooth sound, but cold before sliding one hand on the wall, next to her head.
“Oh princess… don’t be scared. I barely bite.” He made as if to lean forward to steal a kiss, but Fel’ felt a shiver of fear from something much more dangerous…
Without a word she brought the spray up, and aimed at blue-head face, pressing down and spraying him at close range.

But instead of backing off in pain, he blinked and used his spare hand to wipe some of the orange sheen that had gathered on his cheek.
Then he looked back at her, very amused.
“Was this supposed to do something princess?” he asked, sucking on his finger with a wide smile…

Before Fel’ could say anything or do anything, there was a rush of wind. Blue-head face contorted in sudden fear, and he made a move as if to back off. He wasn’t given time to do so. Something grabbed him by the shirt, throwing him backward and away from Fel to land against the coffee table with a resounding crash.

Fel’ heard Lois cry out in surprise and fear, from the sudden and violent display, and she watched as her mysterious silver haired saviour once again turned to smile smugly at her. He seemed to have just appeared out of nowhere, once again to her rescue…
Exuding confidence he held out a hand to her, like an invitation to dance.
“Are you alright?” he asked, and it was the first time she heard him talk. His voice was silk and honey alike, made to seduce and to charm, and he had a slight accent that made his words like music.
And Fel’ could hear the hidden poison beneath every drop of honey.

Slapping his hand aside, she pushed herself off the wall angrily, pointing a finger at him, and refraining just so from poking him in the chest.
“You! You told me to come here!” He only smiled, not denying it and so she went on “Why did you do that?!”

“You’ll have to precise what that is. Bringing you here? Saving your life? Twice?”

Fel’ was sparred an answer by the sudden yowling hiss that came from blue-head. He pushed himself up again, and glared at them, blood running down the side of his head and teeth barred… And Fel’ did a double-take because his teeth were more like fangs and how did she miss this earlier?!

“You bastard!” blue-head snarled “The hell was that for?! I was just kidding!”

“And I warned you. All of you. That you were not to touch her.” Silver-guy responded, voice no longer enthralling but dangerous and deadly. “You’re lucky I only got you off her.”

“Her is not a prize that need defending!” Lois exclaimed, interrupting them, looking as angry as her voice let on. “You told us to come here! Now would be a good time to explain why the fuck you did so!”
Fel’ nodded, angry too, but also scared. Who were those guys that threw one another around, worked in some sort of sex-bar, and rescued then tricked girls on the street…
Oh hell, please don’t let them be sexual deviant! The thought just crossed her mind, but now Fel’ sincerely hoped she hadn’t led Lois into a death-trap.

“Well what do you think I invited you here for?” Silver-head asked, ignoring Lois entirely and looking at Fel’ the smile back on his face.
Fel’ started to think her face would set in a permanent glare if she continued like this, but she wouldn’t relent.
“I don’t know, that’s why I came, that’s why I ask.” She ground out in answer, only scowling further as this just brought a chuckle to the guy.
Before he stepped forward, making her back off again, but this time she turned to avoid the wall. She wouldn’t made the same mistake twice!

He paused, a step away from her, and looked down at her eyes. He was much taller than he looked, she could see that now that he was up close. She was tempted to kick him… temptation turned to fact as he reached toward her. Her leg shot out, aiming for his crotch. Cheap and easy way to disable a man.
Except that apparently she was too obvious because he caught her ankle and held her there, barely balanced, and grinned.
“Now that’s not very nice, I just wanted to move your hair off your face.”

She hopped on one foot, trying to get him to release her, and he did so… which threw her completely off balance. A curse escaped her as she twisted to try and grab something… her arm met the counter, and she allowed her shoulder to bump into it harshly, to prevent a full fall, gasping at the shock, hearing something fall behind her and feeling something warm and thick suddenly flowing down her back and chest.

She cursed again, jumping away and back to her own two feet, pulling on her shirt, seeing the deep dark red stain that was spreading slowly there. Great! Now she was covered in wine!

“I had just cleaned the counter.” She heard the bartender say in a flat voice, followed by the clink of glasses and bottles. “Sorry Saig, she spilt your breakfast, I’ll make another.” He added, and she saw blue-head snickering.

This had been such a stupid idea to come here… she wasn’t going to get any answer, and to top if off, she now stunk of…
Sniffing her shirt, Fel’ frown turned to confusion. This wasn’t the scent of wine… this was heavier, headier… iron filled…
Looking at her finger, covered in the stuff from where she grasped her shirt, she paled suddenly as the answer clicked in her mind. She looked up to see Lois white and shaking, already aware. They crossed gaze…
And scampered. Out the door, back up the stairs, running down the street and thinking only of one thing: putting as much distance as they could between them and this fucking creepy weird place.
Because it wasn’t wine that had spilt on Fel’ shirt. It was blood.</Text>

            <Title>Running Home</Title>
            <Synopsis>Fel run home and later tell her friends what happened but they are much less concerned about this than her</Synopsis>
            <Text>They ran, without stop, faster and longer than they ever would of thought they could. Ignoring the shouts and the laughters around them. The patrons leaving the nearby bars and night-houses, or entering them.
They ran and ran, until they finally reached a well lit crossroad, far enough away. Hands on their knees they panted to try and get some breath back.

Fel’ could feel her skin crawl, as with every breath she felt the blood-stick shirt cling to her chest, and the smell was everywhere around her. Enough to make her nearly sick.
She wanted nothing more than to remove it, but doing so in the middle of the street, so near Pigalle… it was asking for troubles.

“We are… never… returning there.” Lois stated as soon as she was able to speak again, and Fel’ nodded as best as she could. There was no reason, in the whole world, that was worth returning into this… whatever that place was.
A cross between whorehouse, and criminal ring. With a hint of cult in it.

They looked around to the many people that still crossed the street at this hour, and Lois suddenly shuffled out of her jacket and held it out to Fel’
“Here… hide your shirt, don’t want to get arrested.”
They aimed for the nearest subway station, both shivering from the chilly night air, and the adrenaline fallout. Lois was gnawing at her nails, eyes darting nervously all around, while Fel’ simply tried not to cringe every time she moved slightly and the fresh smell of blood wafted out of the jacket.
She kept thinking back on all the little weird details, trying to rationalise what she had seen.

The bright shiny eyes were due to the lights in the room… the fangs… same thing, a trick of the light and fear.
The seemingly insane strength they used was down to… well they hadn’t used that much strength and martial art people could do even more crazy stuff so that made sense didn’t it?

The more she thought about it, the more this whole thing seemed like a very bad and dangerous joke, played on her by a group of very dangerous people. And the only logical conclusion about this was…
“We should call the cops… that bottle had blood in it, it’s creepy and weird as fuck, and that alone would be enough for them to check out…” she muttered, looking at Lois who had finally stopped torturing her nails.

Lois seemed taken aback and hesitated a second before answering in a small voice
“What if they’re a sort of street gang? Organised crime and stuff? They know our faces, if we tell the cops… what if they come after us?”
And it sort of made sense, really… and she only wanted to call the cops because she felt like she should do something about this place and the weirdos in it.
“Well, I could tell them alone…”

“Don’t be daft. If you go I’m going too. I mean, you need someone to confirm what you say and I won’t let you take the crap alone.”
Lois voice was hard, but there was now a small smile to her face which comforted Fel’ in her idea. Call the cops, tell them the bar address, tell them what happened tonight and testify. With some luck the whole place would be shut down and that would be that.
If not… well her family wasn’t in the country, as long as their faces and names were never shown, they should be safe.

They reached Lois station, but she didn’t left the train. Fel’ couldn’t blame her not wanting to be alone right now. She also still needed the jacket, to hide her blood-covered shirt, and she didn’t say anything as they continued on until her own station.

When they reached her building, she paused to look at Lois, a silent inquiry to see if she would take her over-garment and leave, but Lois simply pushed past her to get inside.
As soon as she was in, and the door locked, Fel’ removed her caked shirt, throwing it as far away as she could, her nerves breaking again. She jumped under the shower without a word. Lois knew the house anyway, the girls came here often enough.
She scrubbed herself clean, several time, trying to not look at the brownish water that drained away and drowning the smell of blood under that of shampoo… and finally she broke down. Slumping against the shower wall, curling up under the hot water, and sobbing softly. Relief, fear, confusion, anger… it all washed over and away slowly.

When she finally gathered herself enough to stand again, the water had turned cold and she was shivering once more. But this time it was a good kind of shivering. She wrapped her hair in a towel, got into some clean pajama, and exited the room.
She could hear the steam from the kettle, and she entered the kitchen to find as expected, Lois nursing a cup of hot cocoa.
Lois pointed to another steaming cup, sitting on the opposite chair, and Fel’ sat down, remarking the red and puffy eyes immediately. She wasn’t the only one who had a breakdown.

So she decided it was high time for some coping mechanism to kick in, and sniffed the cocoa long and hard before muttering.
“Hope you didn’t let snot in it.”

Lois snort as she almost spat out her cocoa was worth the potential cleanup that could of occurred.
“Like you can talk, you probably hogged all the hot water!”

Fel’ chuckled in return, and they looked at one another with a smile. Finishing their mug silently, enjoying the simple chocolate taste, before putting them in the sink for later washing.
“I did actually… hog the water so…”

“I’ll shower in the morning, I didn’t need it as much.”

“… Are you okay?” it was a stupid question, it sounded like a stupid question, but still… she had to ask.

“I’ll be… after some sleep.” Lois padded to the couch, pulled out a blanket from beneath it, and flopped down without any hesitation. Fel’ smiled as she passed by, lingering at the door frame.
“Night… if you need anything…”

“I know where the toilets are…” Lois voice came muffled from the cushions, and Fel’ laughed as she left the room.

Reaching her own room, she slipped into bed, curling up beneath the covers and hiding away from the world. But despite her best efforts, she kept flashing back to the bar, to the men in there, to what they said and what they did.
As she slipped into a restless sleep, she realised suddenly something else, that only added to her horror.

For some reason, that she couldn’t explain, that she couldn’t rationalise in any way… a part of her had loved all this and wanted to return there.
That terrified her more than everything she had seen that night…</Text>

            <Title>Slow drifting</Title>
            <Synopsis>Fel is torn between fear and curiosity and drifting away from her friends</Synopsis>
            <Text>It was easy to fall into a routine. To start acting the same way, every day, without thinking, to try and drive away a thought or a memory that was too disturbing to think about.
That was what Fel’ did. After her misadventures with Lois, and telling the rest of the group about it, it was unanimously decided that they would report the place to the police, and then forget about it.

They went to the station that same afternoon, gave their testimony and left. And they didn’t hear anything about it since, so they forgot.
Lucia and Julie, who hadn’t been there, forgot easily, pushing this aside as a strange adventure and not paying it any mind.
Lois had a harder time, but in the end, with efforts and the help of the others, she managed to push it all from mind.
And Fel’… well she thought she could do it too. For a while she even believed she did. But every time she started to think she was rid of this whole affair, a flash of colour, a voice, a sight, would bring her back to the bar, and to that strange disturbing feeling of belonging there.
She hid it. For the first time as long as she recalled, she was lying to her friends about something big. Not just a little white lie, or excuse made about stupid things like everyone did. She had a hunch that this wasn’t normal, maybe she even needed help, but she didn’t want any.

She felt fine, aside from that on and off urge to return to that strange bar, and this urge she could drown out.
By throwing herself body and soul in routine.
Home, School, Homeworks. Rinse and repeat.

But her friends weren’t fooled and they asked about it from time to time. “Fel you okay?” “Fel you look down, what’s the matter?”
She started avoiding the girls. It was the easiest solution. Progressively she started going out with them less. Hanging with them less.

Before long she had drifted apart from them entirely, isolating herself from the quarto.

Weeks after the encounter, a wandering funfair opened in the city outskirt. Fel’ heard several times the girls talk about going there, but never once did they mention inviting her, nor did she ask.
She was getting tight on money too. Enough to eat, her parents helped as always with the rent. But she was too close to broke to go to a fair and enjoy it.

But staying at home wasn’t an option either. She had cleaned the place already so many times out of boredom, games and books sounded boring at the moment, and staying dead in front of the tv… she had done enough of that to make her sick of the screen. In fact the more she thought of it, the more she felt only one thing: an itch. That itch, that idea of going back. Solve the mystery of the bar.

She spent a good half hour arguing with herself back and forth, reasons for not going and reasons for setting off immediately.
Finally, if only to shut up her own mind, she grabbed her coat and keys and slammed the door shut, taking the quickest path to the subway.

Stupid… stupid! You’re going alone, in a place where a bunch of weirdos store blood in bottles! What are you thinking?!
She berated herself all the way, but never hesitated as she switched stations, keeping a distracted eye on the display to not miss the one she got off at.
And you don’t even have pepper spray or whatever! Whatever use it was last time I guess it’s no big loss, but still… should of taken a pen knife!

The train stopped, people pushing in and out of it. Fel’ elbowing her way out of the crowd and finally emerging from the station in the crisp autumn air.
Without pausing she entered Pigalle, which looked much less alive in the middle of the day, with the people simply rushing about and many of the coloured signboards closed.
One woman among the crowd wasn’t glanced at twice and she found her way back to the small alley easily enough.

Standing at the front door, then she hesitated. She stared at the metal panel, knowing what was behind it, and feeling that urge of knowing more, of going back and learning about all of this.
Taking a deep breath, Fel’ squashed that feeling down, and pushed the door open, taking the stairs down two at the time. She reached the door, grasped the handle, turned it…

And it rattled. And rattled again as she repeated the gesture to the same result: the door was locked.
Which made sense, for the kind of place it was. Made even more sense if the place had been closed down by the police but it didn’t look like anything violent had taken place and Fel’ couldn’t help but think the weird bunch would of fought…

She considered trying to force the door, but if they were still in business it would only bring her troubles. And yet now that she was here, she was loathe to leave.

As she lost time considering options and trying to come up with some suitable plan for what to do next, she heard a small cough from behind.

“Leave or stay miss, but can you at least not block the door? Those bags are not a little bit heavy, and I’d like to put them away.”
The voice was polite, posh actually, smooth and lilted.
Fel’ spun around and found herself face to neck with another man she had not seen here before. Donned in a green gorgeous cloak with fringes and cuff-links, and lined with golden threads.
He had long hair too, tied in a tight and high ponytail, a sort of faded auburn. And he had a kind smile, a genuine smile that made Fel’ tension much less than it should of been… that and the paper bags full to the brim of groceries that he was carrying in each arms. It made him look much less threatening to be holding potatoes.

“I… er…” she tried to think of something to say, some excuse. That guy might be looking nice and smiley, but coming here during the day and in those clothes? He was most probably one of the weirdos too.

“Oh! Wait… are you the young Lady that Darkon mentioned maybe? He did say you might be passing by!” the smile got even wider, like a young kid being told about holidays or some other good things, and he tried to juggle the bags up around to free a hand, holding it out for Fel’ to shake.
As he did so, several of the potatoes spilt from the bags and crashed to the floor, rolling here and there to the dismay of the nice-guy.
“Oh dear, clumsy me.” He looked so disappointed that Fel’ completely dropped her guard. No way this guy was dangerous… even if he was in with the others, he was the errand-boy obviously…

“I’ll get them.” She said, starting to pick up the potatoes, though just in case keeping an eye on the guy.

“Why thank you! I should of taken bigger bags but I couldn’t be bothered. What might be your name milady?”

“… Fel’. What’s yours?” she responded with the tiniest hint of mistrust, but potato-boy appeared not to notice, simply beaming down at her as she shuffled to the last potato, right by the door.
“Sylvain, it’s a real pleasure to meet you Fel. Darkon wouldn’t stop mentioning you, he told us such impressive things, we were all quite eager to meet you.”

“… uh… what?” kneeling by the door, Fel’ blinked up at the boy, not sure what to answer to that. Darkon? One of the creepy dude from last time… and he mentioned her and told good things about her to the other creepy guys and what the hell was going on here?!

Before she could ask anything more, she heard suddenly the rattling of the handle again, this time though with no one on this side touching it.
She didn’t had time to look back before the door banged open, catching her hard in the shoulder and temple.
Projected a couple meters away, she saw stars dancing behind her eyes as pain exploded in her skull. Dropping the handful of potatoes, she slumped to the ground, tears in her eyes, and she faintly heard above her, two voice talking.

“Good job Damien, of all the stupid things to do, a door in her face.” Fel’ blinked, nauseous from the blow and confused. This sounded like nice-guy voice but… it was suddenly different, dangerous and sharp… and the voice that answered sounded young and slightly… roguish?
“Well how was I supposed to know she was behind the door?! Man, Darkon is going to have my hide for that… think he won’t notice if I put her to bed and heal her up?”

“How stupid do you think he is? No, make that, how stupid don’t you think you are?”

She heard footsteps, saw a vague shape of beige and orange swim in front of her… then something warm covered her eyes and she slipped into nothingness.</Text>

            <Synopsis>Fel returned to the bar, alone, and got knocked out by accident
She wake in a strange place with even stranger people around</Synopsis>
            <Text>Light. Too much light. Fel’ groaned, bringing a hand up to her face, and pulling on the bed cover to try burrow back into the warm darkness of sleep.
Why had she left the light on before going to bed? And damn, her bed had never felt that nice… comfy, and soft and so much better than normal.
It even smelt of… roses?

Fel’ frowned suddenly, springing sitting and looking around wildly. She wasn’t in her room. That was something obvious right at first glance. The bed she was in was a king size, surrounded in velvet drapery a deep red. The walls were also covered in blood-tinted wallpaper on top of dark wooden panels and chandelier mounted regularly. The ground was a shiny and waxed wood, and the few furnitures were the same craftsmanship quality, like renaissance item with golden adornments.

Pushing the blanket off her, she swung her legs out of the bed, only then remarking that she was no longer wearing her shirt and jeans, but instead a long frilly nightgown, so light she barely felt it, in a deep emerald colour.
And nothing beneath. And that creeped her out beyond words.

Getting out of bed, she ran to the door and rattled the handle a few times but the door remained decidedly closed.
Starting to panic now, and seeing no windows whatsoever, Fel’ ran to the dresser and pulled the drawers open one by one, until finally she found a metal hanger made from what looked like -at first glance- silver.
She returned to the door, intend on trying her newfound weapon against the wood, when the lock clicked open. Holding the hanger high she held her breath as the door opened. And swung it down on the figure that came in the room.

There was a surprised sound of pain, followed by a cascade of crashes and shatters. Errand-boy -Sylvain- had jumped away from her, holding his hands to his head where the hanger connected with his skull, the remains of toasts and chocolate spilt around on the ground from the platter he had been carrying and had dropped.

“Oooh that wasn’t nice at all.” He complained, gingerly probing his head, and wincing. But Fel’ didn’t really care, she was still very much panicked.
“Where am I? What did you do to me?!” she demanded, still brandishing the hanger.

“We didn’t do anything.” He protested, looking very much harmless indeed, but Fel’ wasn’t fooled. She remembered hearing them just before she lost consciousness. “You took a hit from the door, we brought you here to make sure you would be alright.”

“As if. Someone changed my clothe. You pervs changed my clothes!” Fel’ snarled, though she did step away from the door. No point getting knocked out a second time if someone arrived to check on the noise. She did thought of running but without knowing the place she risked getting caught long before she reached the exit.

“We put you into more comfortable clothes yes, but I hardly see how this qualify as perverted behaviour!” Sylvain had straightened again, and glared at her in turn, looking quite nonplussed by the hanger now that he was facing it directly. “And you should really put that away before you hurt someone… else.”

Fel’ was about to snap again, when he heard footsteps approaching. One second was all she had to decide whether or not to attack the arriving person, but a small voice in her head told her it would be a very bad idea and she backed off as far from the door as she could.
It swung open, and the silver headed figure that had come to haunt her more recent memories stepped in.
The change in the room was immediate, Sylvain forgot all about his head and placed a hand to his chest before bowing like an old-school butler, and didn’t straighten.
Silver-head ignored him utterly, looking at Fel’ with a slight smile and a hint of curiosity.

“You’re alright then? Good.” He made to walk toward her, but remarked the metal hanger and one of his eyebrow rose in amusement. “I’m not sure this would be much use as weapon, you risk more injuring yourself with it, than me.”

“I’ll call the police. I’ll tell them about you depraved bunch and that you changed me when I was out of it. You’ll get arrested.” Fel’ threatened in response, hoping to get some hint of fear or worry to show. But instead she got a mocking chuckle.

“Like they arrested us before? We do know you told them about the blood. It was quite an amusing day, let me tell you, two officers coming to see us. It’s far from the first time we had to deal with this and as you can see, this is a useless threat to use against us. So let’s drop it shall we?” he stepped forth, getting closer, and Fel’s grip on the hanger tightened. “You won’t call anyone. You don’t want to call anyone. You came back here of your own accord, because you wanted to. Dare you deny it?”

He was standing centimeters away but Fel’ did not even try to strike. Because he was right, because she did want to know. Because deep down inside, she came back on her own for answers. And damn the fear, damn the risks, damn the weirdness. This time she would get them.
“Ok… yes I wanted to come back. I wanted to know what happened last time I was here. What was in that bottle, and what… what are you and your creepy friends doing here?”

“Put away the hanger and we’ll discuss this like civilised beings.” He replied, now grinning and Fel’ was well aware that he was asking that only to annoy her. He wasn’t threatened in the least, she could of been naked he wouldn’t have felt any different. Speaking of…

“Not until I know who changed me. And why. Because this is perverted and whoever did this, you’re not having them anywhere near me. Ever again.”

His smirk widened, and he leaned forward, until her back was flat against the wall. Then he whispered to her softly.
“I did it.” He straightened again then continued in a normal voice. “And before you start to scream again, those are your clothes. I don’t need to get you naked to change what you wear. I will never force you into anything. Now will you put away the hanger?”

Fel’ blinked a few times, her brain having a hard time coming up with some appropriate answer.
Because that guy was barking crazy. Just completely crazy. He spoke nonsense and acted like it was some big mystery. Maybe this was what the answer was, those guys were unstable mentally. And she jumped right in their midst so she had to be too.

“Right.” She said slowly, lowering the hanger slightly. Best way around crazies was to not push them into a fit or anything. Or so she thought. “Sooo… I’m going to put away the hanger, and you’re going to tell me more about that.”

Silver-head laughed again. “Brave, and condescending… amusing combination.” He stepped to the bed frame and leaned against one of the wooden post. “Go ahead. Ask some questions, and we’ll see if I give you answers.”

Fel’ glare returned full force, but she forced herself to stay calm, taking a deep breath and trying to chose what question she should ask first. She finally settled for the obvious.
“Who are you? And your… friends or whatever?”

Silver-head smirked “My name is Darkon. I’m the leader and owner of this establishment, known as the Martyr’s Bar. And the others here work for me. Do I need to detail what kind of place this is, or do you already know?”
Fel couldn’t help but think he was enjoying this way too much, and his teasing tone earned a severe blush from her, but she shook her head.
“No I get that picture fine. What I want to know is why you saved me that day, then ran off… you tricked me into coming here from the start, you played with me to get me there instead of being honest and open. Why?”

Darkon eyes glinted as he watched her, and he didn’t answer immediately this time. His smirk was gone too.
“I tricked you because I had no choice. You would of never came here otherwise, no matter if I saved you or not. Instinct alone would of prevented you. Because you see, we aren’t humans. And with the smell and energy you have? You aren’t either.”</Text>

            <Synopsis>Fel is offered something unique by what appear to be the leader of this strange place</Synopsis>
            <Text>“Not human?… What do you mean, not human?!”
Darkon’s words had been followed by a momentary stunned silence, but Fel recovered soon enough. And she was now convinced that they were completely mad. Mental-institution cases that should return in said mental institution right now.

“Yeah no, that’s it. I’m out of here.” She snapped, pushing herself away from the wall, trying to storm past Darkon who was still smirking. His arm shot out to catch hers, and she snarled, trying to fight him off.
“Let go of me!”

“Not until you listen.”

“I won’t listen to this… craziness anymore! Not humans! Next you’re going to tell me about unicorns and leprechauns!” she tried to claw his hand off with her nails, but he refused to let go.”

“Well actually I could…” she huffed, and he stopped but still did not let her go. His other hand came toward her, and Fel’ struggled more than she ever did. But her strongest struggles did nothing. He was unmoving, she was exhausting herself as fruitlessly as if she was pushing a boulder.
His hand was level with her torso, and she wondered if he would strike her, try to touch her inappropriately…

She expected something to happen. But she was absolutely not ready for what did happen. Darkon fingers snapped, a loud, sharp noise. Immediately small flames started to dance along his fingers, and he splayed them out to make sure Fel’ could see them well.
She stopped struggling immediately, looking at his hand, mouth open in surprise. Her brain was having a very hard time catching up with what she was seeing.
Fire could not be summoned like he just did… it just couldn’t. There had to be a trick!

So was grasping to some logical explanation, when he started waving his fingers, and the flames turned green, then blue, deep red. Even a pitch black, and a white so pure it hurt the eyes. He had finally released her arm, but she wasn’t thinking of running anymore. She was staring, hypnotised, at the flames. She extended a hand to touch them, but Darkon took his own back with a smile.
“Ah-ah… it’s still fire. It burns.” He said, obviously amused.

She looked at him, her defiance still there but nearly entirely drowned by the surprise and disbelief.
“It… It can’t… you… How are you doing that?” she finally managed to string enough words together to form a coherent sentence. Darkon laughed, extinguishing the flames.
“Focus. Energy manipulation… knowing what you’re doing is half the work with what you call magic.”

“Magic is real.” Fel’ whispered, the fact downing. “Magic… is real. Magic is real… Magic is freaking real!” she finished on a scream, but held out a hand immediately. “No! No I’m fine… just… getting to grip. Magic is real. Okay. You’re not human… what are you?”

“Tell me what you are first. I’m very curious to be honest.”

“I’m not… Wait, you said… I’m not human.” She couldn’t believe that. She was born from human parents, she was humans… “I never showed any sort of magic before…”

“Never?” now it was Darkon’s turn to frown. He had been expecting another answer, maybe harry potter style… but Fel’ was sure of it: she never did anything magical. Ever.
She shook her head, and his frown deepened, before finally she shrugged it off.
“Well maybe you’re only partly disnormal. Enough that we can smell it, but not enough that you would inherit any special traits. Which is a real shame but it can’t be helped… It does change my plans a bit I suppose.”

Oh. Right, he did made her come. He thought she was magical, he thought she was something like him, and the other that worked here. She wasn’t sure if she heard right just then, what did he means by “disnormal”? But insulting or not, he had been curious because he thought her one of them. What was he going to do to her, now that she said she wasn’t… magical.
Worry mounted again, and she backed off away from Darkon once more.
“What plan?” she asked, cautious.

He waved a hand in the air, as if physically chasing away the question.
“Nothing big, I just thought you would make a good partner, figured it was a case of unknown capacities and thought that freeing you from the boring humans and their lifestyle would make you thankful and you would like me in return.”

Fel’ blinked. Was he stupid? Or joking maybe? No he looked serious, he really just said all that out loud, and believed it, as if it was obvious and not offensive at all!
She heard a light slap from somewhere on her right, and glancing briefly there, she saw Sylvain had just face-palmed. She had completely forgotten about him. He’d been watching it all. He also obviously didn’t thought much of Darkon’s social skills, but that wouldn’t help her now. Even if she did try escape Darkon, if he got dangerous -and who was she kidding, he already was!- she wouldn’t be able to escape that guy too.

“You do realise how wrong that sound… right?” she asked, reporting her attention back on Darkon.
He looked at her, and seemed confused.
“… No not really. Does it? Is that a human thing then? That the truth sound wrong?”

“What…? No! It’s not a human thing, it’s just a thing! You don’t… that’s manipulation! It’s wrong by default!”

“Oh right. It’s wrong if I tell you about it. I forgot… well anyway, it doesn’t matter anymore, since this plan is scratched. Can’t do anything with you if you’re powerless. But I did invest a bit of time, and I’d be curious how someone “normal” react to knowing about it, and learning about the different non-humans out there.”

“You want me to come back here? To visit you guys?” That… would be the weirdest thing ever, but if that meant they wouldn’t try to hurt her, or silence her for knowing their secrets she was alright with it.

“Well yes, but you can’t come here that often without a reason. And I doubt you’d become a regular client if I asked.” Darkon smirk was there again, and Fel’s felt herself blush.
“No I wouldn’t.” She grumbled out, waiting for him to finish laughing and propose a better idea.

“We could make her work here.” The cultured, soft voice came from the corner of the room where Sylvain was, and both Fel’ and Darkon turned to look at him.

“It would expand our clientele but once again, I can’t see her agreeing.” Darkon retorted, and Sylvain bowed once more -when had he even pulled out of the bow the first time?- explaining.
“I wasn’t thinking of having her work with clients, of any type. I was more thinking of menial tasks. Cleaning the rooms, carrying clean sheets and clothes to us, help Deerck with the bar and drinks, and the cleaning of the glasses.”

“Ooooh! Maid work! Yes that is a good idea!” Darkon looked delighted by the idea and turned to Fel’ with a wide grin. “It’ll be perfect, you’ll work here during the afternoons whenever you can, you won’t be just in our legs and I’ll still get to have you around!” he didn’t appear about to ask Fel’ what she thought of this, and so she took it upon herself to do so.
“And what if I don’t like that idea?”

Darkon smile faded a bit, then returned but it had gone from a happy-boy smile to a predatory one.
“You’ll be well paid. And you can’t deny that you are curious. Why wouldn’t you like that idea?”

Both good points, but she wouldn’t admit it. Not so easily.
“Because you acted like a jerk, scared me half to death, you and your merry band, several times. Doesn’t make me want to come back every so often.”

“You’ll never find another chance than us, to learn about the disnormal. Because if you ask elsewhere and risk the secret, you’ll be silenced before you’ll be able to explain yourself. But if you want it that dearly, then let me ask you: Do you want to work here with us, as a maid, and learn about our world?”

And despite the tiny voice in her head that screamed no, despite her best instinct telling her it was a bad idea, despite having read so many books where this kind of situation turned very bad… Fel’ smirked in turn. And said yes.</Text>

            <Title>First day</Title>
            <Synopsis>Fel first working day, a week after the offer, where she is given a uniform and some set of rules...</Synopsis>
            <Text>The thing with working for supernatural beings was that there was no real contracts. Or insurance, or any other type of paperworks of any sort. Because they were beyond human laws and they didn’t care much for anything.
The same actually applied to their client. Fel wasn’t surprised to hear that the Martyr’s bar was completely outside of legality. It only made her wonder how they managed to convince the police to not poke around too much if they had no papers for that…

But the advantage was that the week following her “recruitment”, she didn’t had to fill in anything, she hadn’t needed to deposit any sort of folder anywhere… She simply received a letter, at her home -the fact that they knew where she lives bothered her a lot more than she allowed herself to show- giving her the time at which she was to show up come next monday.

So after making sure that her homework were all done, days in advance -she wouldn’t fully sacrifice school for this mess- she placed a knife and a bottle of water in her bag, and left for the bar.
She got there five minutes early, which she considered good impression for a first day at a new job, and as weird as this whole situation was, it was still a new job. So Fel intended to act appropriately.

Down the creepy staircase once more, and knocking on the wooden door without hesitation this time, she waited with fidgety nervousness until the wooden panel opened.
She expected the kind faced Sylvain, or the silver framed face of Darkon… but the one that welcomed her inside was instead a frazzled, sleepy looking pale young man with electric blue hair.

Oh she remembered him. She would have a very hard time forgetting this bastard, and now that she knew they weren’t humans, she had a sneaking suspicion of what exactly he was.
The young man blinked at Fel twice, before a positively carnivorous smile stretched his lips.
“Well look who arrived just on time for breakfast! Darling you shouldn’t have!”

Fel scowled, and stepped back, then steeled herself. She was working here now, she wasn’t going to let this little cretin tease her and make her embarrassed!
“It’s my first day working here. If you could let me in. Thanks.” Clipped tone and to the point. But the point sailed right over his blue head and he leaned in toward her… no toward her neck. Okay that was bad.
“But honey you wouldn’t leave me all alone and in pain right?” he asked, and he had been about to reach for her when a voice called from inside

“Saig! Stop harassing the maid, get back in here!”

Saig -Weird name, and yes she was the one saying this- looked back and started to pout, but he gracefully stepped back and finally allowed Fel inside.
She crossed the entrance without a look back at him, even if she could hear him following her.

The reception room was the same as she remembered… maybe the cushion had been moved a bit about but that was about it.
Behind the bar, the same barman as the first time, making some sort of cocktail and not looking at her or Saig.
Saig who went and flopped down on one of the couch, twisting like a snake until he could lounge like an overgrown cat and look at her at the same time.
She resolutely ignored him, and looked at the barman.
“So… I…”

“Your uniform is in the reserve. You’ll start by cleaning up this room, broom and buckets in the reserve as well. When you’re done, come see me, and I’ll give you soap and glasses to clean up.”
He debited those instruction without even glancing her way a single time. Fel wasn’t sure if she preferred this blatant indifference to the much too intense interest Saig displayed, but she said nothing, simply nodding and making her way to the door half hidden on the side of the bar.
That was probably the reserve… the barman didn’t say anything to stop her, and when she opened the door, she saw that she had been right.

Setting down her bag, she looked around for her uniform. From all the mess she had seen so far, she expected a maid outfit right from the Internet with the white and black frills and aprons and the little inconvenient bows everywhere… That or some sort of fetish costume. Something that would fit with the “theme” of the place.
Instead she was faced with </Text>
